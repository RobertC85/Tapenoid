Raspberry pi and compatible clone software for loading / saving computer data to and from simple audio cassette
Requires raspberry pi 1b or better, usb audio interface and portable cassette recorder
this is a brand new repo based on a concept originated in the mid 1970s. the actual grunt of the program will be a python script titled PyKCS but i'm going to try and add many formats for actual vintage computer emulators
